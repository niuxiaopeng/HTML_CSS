        Steve Jobs once said,
        <q>
            One home run is much better than two doubles.
        </q>

    <blockquote>

            &#8220;In most people&#8217;s vocabularies, design is a veneer. It&#8217;s interior decorating. It&#8217;s
            the fabric of the curtains, of the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design.
            Design is the fundamental soul of a human-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer
            layers of the product.&#8221;
